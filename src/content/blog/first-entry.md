## The state of affairs

As I write this, it's day 1 of my first week unemployed. I hold no ill will towards my former employer, they did the best they could with what they had and had to make difficult decisions that they knew would impact people's lives and I know I couldn't have done that. I wish them the best and that their work is successful.

That said, this doesn't work out well for me! I'm stressed, not gonna lie, it's not fun being laid off. But that's just the way it goes sometimes, and you try to take what lessons you can from the experience and move on to new pastures.

What have I learned in my time? That communication and writing are incredibly important. Yes, it can be a slog to think of what to write, and as I sit typing this I need to make sure I don't lapse into some stream-of-consciousness jabbering.

Making friends and maintaining those friendships is also, if not more so, huge. It's not enough to say "we'll stay in touch" or reaching out once a year for New Years or Christmas or `pick-your-holiday-of-choice`. You want to be involved in people's lives, be there to help them, to talk them through things and to support them and be supported in turn.

So here I am, sitting in my office with basically the same setup I had at my former employer, trying to reestablish myself and figure out what's next. As I said, this is hard. Every part of me wants to go sit on the couch, watch mindless YouTube and Instagram reels and just dissociate. But I can't let myself wallow too long. There are too many people who are important to me who are depending on me.
